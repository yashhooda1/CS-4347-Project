# CS-4347-Project
Worked on the GUI Interface for the Library search project for my CS 4347 - Database Systems class. Tested 5 random books as part of the process, created a checkout, checkin, and randomized borrower data as part of the interface. Was part of a group project for the class. This was only my part of the project. Not the full project.
